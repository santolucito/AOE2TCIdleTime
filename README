# AOE2TCIdleTime calculator

This is a command line utility to calculate your TC idle time in AoE2.

### Can't I just use Capture Age?

You can also use Capture Age to find out your TC idle time but that requires running the game.
Capture Age fully simulates the game, and calculates idle time through that simulation.
That means in order to get the idle time, you need to sit through the game again =.
Even running on the fastest simulation speed, this is still a bit slow.

By running on the command line, you can batch process recorded game files

### Limitations

This tool will only tell you the TC idle time up until you click Castle Age

### Known bugs

If you queue up Castle Age behind a bunch of villagers, this will break the calculator, as it assumes the time you clicked the Castle age upgrade is the end of the productive TC time.
